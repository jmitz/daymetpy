{"name":"DaymetPy","tagline":"A python Daymet download script","body":"# DaymetPy\r\nforked from https://bitbucket.org/khufkens/daymetpy\r\n\r\nFunctions to (batch) download single pixel [Daymet data](http://daymet.ornl.gov/) directly into your python workspace, or save them as csv files on your computer. Both a batch version as a single download version are provided. Consider downloading gridded data if you download extensive coverage within a single region.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nclone the project to your home computer using the following command (with git installed)\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/khufkens/daymetpy.git\r\n\r\nor download by hitting the download button and unzip the file.\r\n\r\nNext, make the script executable\r\n\r\n\tchmod +x /foo/bar/daymetpy.py\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nFor a single site use the following format in a python script after importing the module:\r\n\r\n \tdownload_Daymet(site=\"Oak Ridge National Laboratories\",lat=36.0133,lon=-84.2625,start_yr=1980,end_yr=2010,internal=TRUE)\r\n\r\nwith the subroutine as found in the script. You can use this subroutine in your own code if needed. This subroutine takes the following parameters.\r\n  \r\nParameter     | Description                      \r\n------------- | ------------------------------ \t\r\nsite\t      | site name\r\nlat           | latitude of the site\r\nlon           | longitude of the site\r\nstart_yr      | start year of the time series (data start in 1980)\r\nend_yr        | end year of the time series (current year - 2 years / for safety, tweak this check to reflect the currently available data)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn stand alone mode, on a terminal you are restricted to batch mode. Batch mode uses a comma separated file with site names and latitude longitude which are sequentially downloaded. Format of the comma separated file is as such: site name, latitude, longitude.\r\n\r\n\t./daymetpy.py my_sites_file.csv\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
